## As it says on the tin, this blog will mainly be about cyber security with some web development and computer science concepts thrown in.

My name is Nez Mustafa and I am an aspiring web and app developer with a strong interest and passion for cyber security and cryptography, as I progress on my arduous but exciting journey to break into the tech world and become a professional developer working (hopefully one day) in tech security, I will post anything I learn on this blog as a way to both showcase and reinforce what I have learned as well as giving information to others who are also on the same journey.
