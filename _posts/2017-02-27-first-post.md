## As it says on the tin, this blog will mainly be about cyber security with some web development and computer science concepts thrown in.

My name is Nez Mustafa and I am an aspiring web and app developer with a strong interest and passion for cyber security and cryptography, as I progress on my arduous but exciting journey to break into the tech world and become a professional developer working (hopefully one day) in tech security, I will post anything I learn on this blog as a way to both showcase and reinforce what I have learned as well as giving information to others who are also on the same journey.



## What is the “internet” and how does it work?

Before I delve into any sort of cyber security concepts or anything else, I think it is imperative to nail down some computer science fundamentals so that everything else would be easily understood later on, namely the structure of the internet and the devices that make it up. This post explains what the internet is and talks about the different types of computers that exist.


## Where to begin?


The Internet’s growth has become a phenomenon and it’s impossible to imagine to imagine life without it. The humble beginnings of the internet can be traced as far back as the 1950s when initial concepts of “packet networking”originated in several computer science laboratories in the United States, United Kingdom, and France a topic which is beyond the scope of this blog post.
In any case its seems impossible to escape the bombardment of http://www.com‘s seen constantly on television, heard on radio, and seen in magazines and a solid understanding of it is needed.

Before we go any further an important distinction has to be made between the terms “Internet” and “World Wide Web” which are often used interchangeably in everyday speech. The “Internet” is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use various internet protocol suites , specifically (TCP/IP) ,to link devices worldwide a “network of networks”, whereas  the “World Wide Web”  or “the Web” is only one of a large number of Internet services. The Web is a collection of interconnected documents (web pages) and other web resources, linked by things called  “hyperlinks”and “URLs”.


## Types of computers

There are five types of Computers that, along with some other devices  make up the internet ;

* Supercomputers
* Servers
* Workstations
* Personal Computers
* Microcontrollers

Let’s look at each in turn.

Super-computers are the biggest type of computer, they are computers with multiple central processing units (CPUs) with high-level computational capacity compared to a general-purpose computer, all CPUs work on the same problem at the same time using a technique called parallel processing.

<strong>Modern supercomputers.</strong>

Servers  both hold and access a lot of data and programs. They are a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called “clients” which connect to them, like the device you are using to read this blog right now. This architecture is called the client-server model, we call devices that spit out data or websites servers because they are “serving” the website or data to us.

<strong>Servers in a server room.</strong>





<strong>Workstation computers</strong> look similar to modern day personal computers but they are a lot more powerful and expensive, they offer top of the range speed and power  and are designed for numerous different professional industries.

<strong>Various HP workstations.</strong>





<strong>Personal computers</strong>are the most common by far they are general-purpose computers whose size  capabilities and price make it feasible for individual use, they can be used several different purposes such as gaming. PCs can include desktops or laptops windows machines or iMacs, iMacs and MacBooks are just personal computers with different operating systems.

<strong>Everyday gaming PC</strong>










A Microcontroller is a computer that performs a specialist task and one that cannot be used in the same way as a personal computer , it usually has an integrated circuit containing a processor core, memory, and programmable input/output peripherals. A good example would be the computer in modern cars with a touch screen input/output and also the tiny programmable raspberry pi which you can connect to a monitor and program yourself.

<strong>Raspberry pi 2 model B</strong>



<strong><em>So there we have it! We’ve talked a bit about what comprises the internet itself and gone into detail about the computers that are in existence today, in the next blog post we will talk about  how computers are able to connect to each other and exchange information.</em></strong>
