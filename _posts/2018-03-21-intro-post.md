#Introductory post

## As it says on the tin, this blog will mainly be about cyber security with some web development and computer science concepts thrown in.

My name is Nez Mustafa and I am a self taught web developer with a strong interest and passion for cyber-security (infosec), cryptography and technology in general. As I embark on my arduous but rewarding journey I will post anything I learn on this blog as a way to both showcase and reinforce what I have learned as well as providing information to others who are also on the same sinuous path as I. My intention is for this to be a as much of an information-rich reference point as possible.

If you wish to look at some of my projects you can navigate to the projects section of this site.


Without further ado let's begin. My next few blog posts will cover the fundamentals of computers and computer science before I delve into coding and infosec.

I am grateful to be sharing my journey with you.
